My name is Javier Orraca and I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building predictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and playing board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data - Life is good.

## Professional

My career includes over a decade of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, and Health Net (a Centene Corporation company). As a Data Scientist at Health Net, I work for a Strategic Insights team supporting our Product Performance organization. I help our business develop predictive algorithms and deploy web apps for our internal leaders and Sales teams. I also get to have some extra fun at work by co-hosting a monthly Centene R User Group for our company's analysts and data scientists. 

## Scatter Podcast

I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders that I interview from time to time. In 2020, I teamed up with a friend, [Joel Dayrit](http://jfdayrit.com/), to further explore data analytics, insights, and data science in business. We hope to be more productive with the podcast in 2021.

## Web Development

I am not a web developer but I created this website using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and the [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package, an R web publishing framework that feels intuitive and easy to use if you're already familiar with R Markdown and blogdown. This site is being hosted for free on GitHub and it costs me $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the future of data science.
