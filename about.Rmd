My name is Javier Orraca and I'm a data scientist. I enjoy building predictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and playing board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data - Life is good.

## Professional

My career includes over a decade of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, and Health Net (a Centene Corporation company). As a Data Scientist at Health Net, I work for a Strategic Insights team supporting our Product Performance organization. I help our business develop predictive algorithms and deploy web apps for our internal leaders and Sales teams. I also get to have some extra fun at work by co-hosting a monthly Centene R User Group for our company's analysts and data scientists. 

## Scatter Podcast

I launched [Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast) to share career tips and insights from data science leaders that I interview from time to time. In 2020, I teamed up with a friend, [Joel Dayrit](http://jfdayrit.com/), to further explore data analytics, insights, and data science in business. We hope to be more productive with the podcast in 2021.

## Full Stack Web Development

While not my primary professional focus, I am a proficient full stack web developer leveraging the R programming language and RStudio ecosystem. I develop and deploy client and server software including websites, APIs, and interactive web applications. For interactive, enterprise-grade web apps, [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is my framework of choice.

`shiny` allows me to build apps with clean UIs, advanced [modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html#scaling-modules), and I can easily inject [HTML](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html), [CSS](https://engineering-shiny.org/css.html), and [JavaScript](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/) for front-end customization. Recently, I've been learning the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language and [Genie](https://genieframework.com/) web framework to augment my data science and app development workflows.

This website was built with [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), an R web publishing framework that feels intuitive and easy to use if you're already familiar with R Markdown and `blogdown`. I host this site for free on GitHub, deploy using Netlify, and I pay $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the future of data science.
