Hands down, he was the inspiration for me starting my own podcast and I still listen to SDS weekly. Being a massive fan of RStudio, I'm super excited about this most recent SDS episode featuring Hadley Wickham, RStudio's Chief Data Scientist and creator of ggplot2, dplyr, author, professor... he's a research and data science genius!.

This episode is a great listen as he explores RStudio Python and R integration and the future of data science.
