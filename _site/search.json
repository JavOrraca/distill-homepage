I enjoy building\npredictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and\nplaying board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data -\nLife is good.\nProfessional\nMy career includes over 15 years of data science, financial strategy,\nand business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Health Net, and Bloomreach. At Bloomreach, my team\napplies data science techniques to empower decision makers with\ndescriptive and prescriptive analytics. I help our business develop and\ndeploy automation solutions, predictive algorithms, and interactive web\napps for our internal leaders, Operations, Product, Marketing, and Sales\nteams.\nScatter Podcast\nIn 2019, I launched Scatter Podcast to\nshare career tips and insights from data science leaders for students,\nbusiness managers, and professionals looking to pivot into data science.\nIt was a fun and incredibly rewarding side project but after 30\nepisodes, I started to feel fatigued with the amount of time it took to\nplan, record, edit, market, etc. The podcast is on hold but not\ndead!\nProgramming & Analytics\nSkills\nR: RStudio pro tools, R Markdown, Shiny, tidyverse,\ntidymodels, distill, plotly, leaflet, fable, feasts, Facebook’s Prophet\n& NeuralProphet R implementations, and many more\nOther Analytics & Programming Platforms:\nJupyterHub, Jupyter Lab, GitLab, GitHub, RStudio Connect, Julia,\nNetBase, SQL, SAP Business Objects, Hugo, Netlify, Quest Analytics\nMicrosoft: Expert-level MS Access and Excel user\nwith experience creating pivot tables, nested IF statements, INDEX /\nMATCH functions, VLOOKUP / HLOOKUP functions, Solver (for optimization\nand simulations… yes… in Excel!), macros for data manipulation\npipelines, ODBC integration, query design (joins, crosstab, make-table,\netc.), reports, and forms\nMedia Appearances\nUC Irvine’s inaugural Latinx Initiative Conference (2021/10/15): https://merage.uci.edu/events/2021/10/2021-lxi-conference.html\nData Points virtual conference hosted by Grid Dynamics (2021/06/09):\nhttps://datapoints.griddynamics.com/events/data-points-virtual-summit-healthcare-finance-06-09-2021/\nScatter Podcast mention on Forbes: https://forbes.com/how-to-get-your-data-scientist-career-started\nScatter Podcast on UC Irvine News: https://merage.uci.edu/news/2019/06/scatterpodcast\nOrange County Predictive Modeling Hackathon Winner: https://twitter.com/oc_rug/status/oc-r-users-group-hackathon-best-model\nUC Irvine Student Profile: https://merage.uci.edu/programs/masters/master-science-business-analytics\nFull Stack Web Development\nWhile not my primary professional focus, I am a proficient full stack\nweb developer leveraging the R programming language and RStudio\necosystem. I develop and deploy client and server software including\nwebsites, APIs, and interactive web applications. For interactive,\nenterprise-grade web apps, R\nShiny is my framework of choice.\nShiny allows me to build apps with clean UIs, advanced modules,\nand I can easily inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end\ncustomization. Recently, I’ve been learning the Julia programming language and Genie web framework to augment my\ndata science and app development workflows.\nThis website was built with Distill, an R web\npublishing framework that feels intuitive and easy to use if you’re\nalready familiar with R Markdown and blogdown. I host this\nsite for free on GitHub, deploy using Netlify, and I pay $15/year for\nthe domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the\nfuture of data science.\nContact Info and Social\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/orraca/\nScatter Podcast on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast\nGitHub: https://github.com/JavOrraca\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIn the past, I lost track of reality trying to track a gazillion\nlinks covering every data-science-friendly programming language under\nthe sun. **shakes head** Bad idea. Since I program in R\ndaily, I like to keep track of R and RStudio developments. I’m mostly\ngoing to share R resources and some other miscellaneous resources that I\nfind useful for analytics, statistical programming, machine learning,\ndata science workflows, and web app development. I’m enjoying the Julia\nprogramming language recently, so I’ll share resources that I find\nbookmark worthy as well.\nR and Julia are open-source programming languages for statistical\ncomputing and graphics. R has an open and friendly community devoted to\nusing R for data science and making business analytics easy to attain.\nOne of the things that I like most about R is the thousands of packages\navailable making almost everything in R a little easier from\nETL, to method chaining, to developing interactive web apps. Julia is a\nnewer programming language (newer to me) recommended by a coworker.\nUnlike interpreter languages such as R and Python, Julia has significant\nperformance advantages for numerical computations. Julia is a\nmulti-threaded programming language (native parallel processing and\ndesigned for distributed computing), it compiles (it doesn’t interpret\nlower-level languages like C or C++), and there is a growing body of\nscientists and developers finding unique ways to use the language. I\ncertainly welcome any suggestions that you might have for the lists\nbelow!\nR Classics\nR for Data Science: Phenomenal\nintroduction to R, the RStudio IDE, and the tidyverse\ncollection of packages\nAdvanced R: Covers concepts,\nmethods, and advanced object-oriented structures for R\nMastering Shiny: Designed\nto teach the foundations of Shiny for web development and more advanced\nconcepts such as the introduction of modules to the Shiny framework\nR Packages: The definitive\nreference point for R package development “covering workflow and\nprocess, alongside the presentation of all the important moving parts\nthat make up an R package”\nR Applied Resources\nReproducible\nFinance with R: Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio\nAnalysis\nHands-On Machine\nLearning with R: I can’t recommend this resource enough and it’s one\nthat I often have on my desk… Put best by the authors, “this book is\nmeant to help R users learn to use the machine learning stack within R,\nwhich includes using various R packages such as glmnet, h2o, ranger,\nxgboost, lime, and others to effectively model and gain insight from\nyour data.”\nDeep\nLearning with R: In-depth introduction to artificial intelligence\nand deep learning applications with R using the Keras library\nForecasting Principles and\nPractice: Said best by the author, “The book is written for three\naudiences: (1) people finding themselves doing forecasting in business\nwhen they may not have had any formal training in the area; (2)\nundergraduate students studying business; (3) MBA students doing a\nforecasting elective.”\nRegression\nand Other Studies: Super applied textbook on advanced regression\ntechniques, Bayesian inference, and causal inference\nTidy Modeling with R: Over the\nlast few months, I’ve learned a lot from this A to Z resource on\npredictive modeling workflows using the tidymodels framework\nR Packages (my favorites)\ntidyverse: A collection of\npackages for data manipulation and functional programming (I use dplyr,\nstringr, and purrr on a daily basis)\ntidymodels: Hands-down my\npreferred collection of packages for building reproducible machine\nlearning recipes, workflows, model tuning, model stacking, and\ncross-validation\ntidyverts: A collection of\npackages for time series analysis that comes out of Rob Hyndman’s\nlab\nDT: This is an R\nimplementation of the popular DataTables JavaScript library\nthat lets you build polished, configurable tables for use in web\nreports, slides, and Shiny apps\nbs4Dash: This R Shiny\nframework brings Bootstrap 4 + AdminLTE v3.1 dependencies to Shiny\n(including 1:1 support for shinydashboard functions) and\nit’s my go-to for developing enterprise-grade Shiny apps\nleaflet: R\nimplementation of the popular Leaflet JavaScript library for developing\ninteractive maps\nplotly: An extensive graphic\nlibrary for creating interactive visualizations and 3D (WebGL)\ncharts\nJulia\nOfficial\nManual: I’m in the process of reading through this documentation to\nbetter understand the Julia methods, operators, functions,\nfunction-building, and modules\nLearning Materials:\nMany resources are listed here on the official Julia Lang site\nJuno: An Atom-based flexible IDE\nfor Julia\nInstallation\nInstructions: Install Julia, Atom, and Juno\nGenie: This library is a\nfull-stack web framework for modern web apps using Julia\nMedium articles on Julia that interested me:\nFirst\nImpressions of Julia from an R User\nA-Z\nJulia Endpoint with Genie\n\nInstalling Julia on a\nRaspberry Pi\n\n\n\n",
