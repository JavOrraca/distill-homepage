I enjoy building predictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and playing board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data - Life is good.\nProfessional\nMy career includes over 15 years of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, Health Net, and Bloomreach. At Bloomreach, my team applies data science techniques to weaponize data and empower decision makers with descriptive and prescriptive analytics. I help our business develop and deploy automation solutions, predictive algorithms, and interactive web apps for our internal leaders, Operations, Product, Marketing, and Sales teams.\nScatter Podcast\nIn 2019, I launched Scatter Podcast to share career tips and insights from data science leaders for students, business managers, and professionals looking to pivot into data science. It was a fun and incredibly rewarding side project but after 30 episodes, I started to feel fatigued with the amount of time it took to plan, record, edit, market, etc. The podcast is on hold but not dead!\nProgramming & Analytics Skills\nR: RStudio pro tools, R Markdown, Shiny, tidyverse, tidymodels, distill, plotly, leaflet, fable, feasts, Facebook’s Prophet & NeuralProphet R implementations, and many more\nOther Analytics & Programming Platforms: JupyterHub, Jupyter Lab, GitLab, GitHub, RStudio Connect, Julia, NetBase, SQL, SAP Business Objects, Hugo, Netlify, Quest Analytics\nMicrosoft: Expert-level MS Access and Excel user with experience creating pivot tables, nested IF statements, INDEX / MATCH functions, VLOOKUP / HLOOKUP functions, Solver (for optimization and simulations… yes… in Excel!), macros for data manipulation pipelines, ODBC integration, query design (joins, crosstab, make-table, etc.), reports, and forms\nMedia Appearances\nUC Irvine’s inaugural Latinx Initiative Conference (2021/10/15): https://merage.uci.edu/events/2021/10/2021-lxi-conference.html\nData Points virtual conference hosted by Grid Dynamics (2021/06/09): https://datapoints.griddynamics.com/events/data-points-virtual-summit-healthcare-finance-06-09-2021/\nScatter Podcast mention on Forbes: https://forbes.com/how-to-get-your-data-scientist-career-started\nScatter Podcast on UC Irvine News: https://merage.uci.edu/news/2019/06/scatterpodcast\nOrange County Predictive Modeling Hackathon Winner: https://twitter.com/oc_rug/status/oc-r-users-group-hackathon-best-model\nUC Irvine Student Profile: https://merage.uci.edu/programs/masters/master-science-business-analytics\nFull Stack Web Development\nWhile not my primary professional focus, I am a proficient full stack web developer leveraging the R programming language and RStudio ecosystem. I develop and deploy client and server software including websites, APIs, and interactive web applications. For interactive, enterprise-grade web apps, R Shiny is my framework of choice.\nShiny allows me to build apps with clean UIs, advanced modules, and I can easily inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end customization. Recently, I’ve been learning the Julia programming language and Genie web framework to augment my data science and app development workflows.\nThis website was built with Distill, an R web publishing framework that feels intuitive and easy to use if you’re already familiar with R Markdown and blogdown. I host this site for free on GitHub, deploy using Netlify, and I pay $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the future of data science.\nContact Info and Social\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/orraca/\nScatter Podcast on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast\nGitHub: https://github.com/JavOrraca\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIn the past, I lost track of reality trying to track a gazillion links covering every data-science-friendly programming language under the sun. **shakes head** Bad idea. Since I program in R daily, I like to keep track of R and RStudio developments. I’m mostly going to share R resources and some other miscellaneous resources that I find useful for analytics, statistical programming, machine learning, data science workflows, and web app development. I’m enjoying the Julia programming language recently, so I’ll share resources that I find bookmark worthy as well.\nR and Julia are open-source programming languages for statistical computing and graphics. R has an open and friendly community devoted to using R for data science and making business analytics easy to attain. One of the things that I like most about R is the thousands of packages available making almost everything in R a little easier from ETL, to method chaining, to developing interactive web apps. Julia is a newer programming language (newer to me) recommended by a coworker. Unlike interpreter languages such as R and Python, Julia has significant performance advantages for numerical computations. Julia is a multi-threaded programming language (native parallel processing and designed for distributed computing), it compiles (it doesn’t interpret lower-level languages like C or C++), and there is a growing body of scientists and developers finding unique ways to use the language. I certainly welcome any suggestions that you might have for the lists below!\nR Classics\nR for Data Science: Phenomenal introduction to R, the RStudio IDE, and the tidyverse collection of packages\nAdvanced R: Covers R concepts, methods, and structures in detail\nMastering Shiny: Designed to teach the foundations of Shiny for web development and more advanced concepts such as the introduction of modules to the Shiny framework\nR Packages: The definitive reference point for R package development “covering workflow and process, alongside the presentation of all the important moving parts that make up an R package”\nR Applied Resources\nReproducible Finance with R: Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio Analysis\nHands-On Machine Learning with R: I can’t recommend this resource enough and it’s one that I often have on my desk… Put best by the authors, “this book is meant to help R users learn to use the machine learning stack within R, which includes using various R packages such as glmnet, h2o, ranger, xgboost, lime, and others to effectively model and gain insight from your data.”\nDeep Learning with R: In-depth introduction to artificial intelligence and deep learning applications with R using the Keras library\nForecasting Principles and Practice: Said best by the author, “The book is written for three audiences: (1) people finding themselves doing forecasting in business when they may not have had any formal training in the area; (2) undergraduate students studying business; (3) MBA students doing a forecasting elective.”\nRegression and Other Studies: Super applied textbook on advanced regression techniques, Bayesian inference, and causal inference\nTidy Modeling with R: Over the last few months, I’ve learned a lot from this A to Z resource on predictive modeling workflows using the tidymodels framework\nR Packages (my favorites)\ntidyverse: A collection of packages for data manipulation and functional programming (I use dplyr, stringr, and purrr on a daily basis)\ntidyverts: A collection of packages for time series analysis that comes out of Rob Hyndman’s lab\ntidymodels: Hands-down my preferred collection of packages for building reproducible machine learning recipes, workflows, model tuning, model stacking, and cross-validation\nknitr::kable and kableExtra: Learn how to build polished tables for use in reports, slides, and web apps\nshinydashboardPlus: This is my preferred UI framework for clean, enterprise-grade Shiny apps\nleaflet: R implementation of the popular Leaflet JavaScript library for developing interactive maps\nplotly: An extensive graphic library for creating interactive visualizations and 3D (WebGL) charts\nJulia\nOfficial Manual: I’m in the process of reading through this documentation to better understand the Julia methods, operators, functions, function-building, and modules\nLearning Materials: Many resources are listed here on the official Julia Lang site\nJuno: An Atom-based flexible IDE for Julia\nInstallation Instructions: Install Julia, Atom, and Juno\nGenie: This library is a full-stack web framework for modern web apps using Julia\nMedium articles on Julia that interested me:\nFirst Impressions of Julia from an R User\nA-Z Julia Endpoint with Genie\n\nInstalling Julia on a Raspberry Pi\n\n\n\n",
