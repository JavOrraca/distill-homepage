I enjoy building predictive models, developing web applications, cooking, reading, and playing board games. For a living, I get to solve puzzles with data - Life is good.\r\nProfessional\r\nMy career includes over a decade of data science, financial strategy, and business analytics for EY, PG&E, KPMG, and Health Net (a Centene Corporation company). As a Data Scientist at Health Net, I work for a Strategic Insights team supporting our Product Performance organization. I help our business develop predictive algorithms and deploy web apps for our internal leaders and Sales teams. I also get to have some extra fun at work by co-hosting a monthly Centene R User Group for our company’s analysts and data scientists.\r\nScatter Podcast\r\nI launched Scatter Podcast to share career tips and insights from data science leaders that I interview from time to time. In 2020, I teamed up with a friend, Joel Dayrit, to further explore data analytics, insights, and data science in business. We hope to be more productive with the podcast in 2021.\r\nProgramming & Analytics Skills\r\nR: RStudio pro tools, R Markdown, Shiny, tidyverse, tidymodels, distill, plotly, leaflet, fable, feasts, Facebook’s Prophet & NeuralProphet R implementations, and many more\r\nOther Analytics & Programming Tools: SQL, JupyterHub, Jupyter Lab, NetBase, SAP Business Objects, Hugo, Netlify, Quest Analytics, Julia\r\nMicrosoft Excel: pivot tables, nested IF statements, INDEX / MATCH functions, VLOOKUP / HLOOKUP functions, Solver (for optimization and simulations… yes… in Excel!)\r\nMicrosoft Access: macros for data pipelines, data manipulation, ODBC integration, query design (joins, crosstab, make-table, etc.), reports, and forms\r\nMedia Appearances\r\nScatter Podcast mention on Forbes: https://forbes.com/how-to-get-your-data-scientist-career-started\r\nScatter Podcast on UC Irvine News: https://merage.uci.edu/news/2019/06/scatterpodcast\r\nOrange County Predictive Modeling Hackathon Winner: https://twitter.com/oc_rug/status/oc-r-users-group-hackathon-best-model\r\nUC Irvine Student Profile: https://merage.uci.edu/programs/masters/master-science-business-analytics\r\nWeb Development\r\nI am not a web developer but I created this website using the R programming language, RStudio, and the Distill package, an R web publishing framework that feels intuitive and easy to use if you’re already familiar with R Markdown and blogdown. This site is being hosted for free on GitHub and it costs me $15/year for the domain name. Open-source tools are fast, flexible, fun, and the future of data science.\r\nContact Info and Social\r\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/orraca/\r\nScatter Podcast on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast\r\nGitHub: https://github.com/JavOrraca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nIn the past, I lost track of reality trying to track a gazillion links covering every data-science-friendly programming language under the sun. **shakes head** Bad idea. Since I program in R daily, I like to keep track of R and RStudio developments. I’m mostly going to share R resources and some other miscellaneous resources that I find useful for analytics, statistical programming, machine learning, data science workflows, and web app development. I’m enjoying the Julia programming language recently, so I’ll share resources that I find bookmark worthy as well.\r\nR and Julia are open-source programming languages for statistical computing and graphics. R has an open and friendly community devoted to using R for data science and making business analytics easy to attain. One of the things that I like most about R is the thousands of packages available making almost everything in R a little easier from ETL, to method chaining, to developing interactive web apps. Julia is a newer programming language (newer to me) recommended by a coworker. Unlike interpreter languages such as R and Python, Julia has significant performance advantages for numerical computations. Julia is a multi-threaded programming language (native parallel processing and designed for distributed computing), it compiles (it doesn’t interpret lower-level languages like C or C++), and there is a growing body of scientists and developers finding unique ways to use the language. I certainly welcome any suggestions that you might have for the lists below!\r\nR Classics\r\nR for Data Science: Phenomenal introduction to R, the RStudio IDE, and the {tidyverse} collection of packages\r\nAdvanced R: Covers R concepts, methods, and structures in detail\r\nMastering Shiny: Designed to teach the foundations of Shiny for web development and more advanced concepts such as the introduction of modules to the Shiny framework\r\nR Packages: The definitive reference point for R package development “covering workflow and process, alongside the presentation of all the important moving parts that make up an R package”\r\nR Applied Resources\r\nReproducible Finance with R: Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio Analysis\r\nHands-On Machine Learning with R: I can’t recommend this resource enough and it’s one that I often have on my desk… Put best by the authors, “this book is meant to help R users learn to use the machine learning stack within R, which includes using various R packages such as glmnet, h2o, ranger, xgboost, lime, and others to effectively model and gain insight from your data.”\r\nDeep Learning with R: In-depth introduction to artificial intelligence and deep learning applications with R using the Keras library\r\nForecasting Principles and Practice: Said best by the author, “The book is written for three audiences: (1) people finding themselves doing forecasting in business when they may not have had any formal training in the area; (2) undergraduate students studying business; (3) MBA students doing a forecasting elective.”\r\nRegression and Other Studies: Super applied textbook on advanced regression techniques, Bayesian inference, and causal inference\r\nTidy Modeling with R: Over the last few months, I’ve learned a lot from this A to Z resource on predictive modeling workflows using the tidymodels framework\r\nR Packages (my favorites)\r\ntidyverse: A collection of packages for data manipulation and functional programming (I use dplyr, stringr, and purrr on a daily basis)\r\ntidyverts: A collection of packages for time series analysis that comes out of Rob Hyndman’s lab\r\ntidymodels: Hands-down my preferred collection of packages for building reproducible machine learning recipes, workflows, model tuning, model stacking, and cross-validation\r\nknitr::kable and kableExtra: Learn how to build polished tables for use in reports, slides, and web apps\r\nshinydashboardPlus: This is my preferred UI framework for clean, enterprise-grade Shiny apps\r\nleaflet: R implementation of the popular Leaflet JavaScript library for developing interactive maps\r\nplotly: An extensive graphic library for creating interactive visualizations and 3D (WebGL) charts\r\nJulia\r\nOfficial Manual: I’m in the process of reading through this documentation to better understand the Julia methods, operators, functions, function-building, and modules\r\nLearning Materials: Many resources are listed here on the official Julia Lang site\r\nGenie: This library is a full-stack web framework for modern web apps using Julia\r\nMedium articles on Julia that interested me:\r\nFirst Impressions of Julia from an R User\r\nA-Z Julia Endpoint with Genie\r\n\r\nInstalling Julia on a Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
